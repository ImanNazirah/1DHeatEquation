# 1DHeatEquation
Solve 1D Heat Equation by using (FDM) Finite Difference Method and (CNM) Crank Nicholson Method in MATLAB. 

In this group assignment we need to solve 1D heat equation by using FDM & CNM.
Then, we solved the problem with software tools such as MATLAB and write code by using our own logical thinking. 
We precisely explain on how to solve the given proble by refering Assignment 2 FDM&CNMfor1DHeatEquation.pdf.
